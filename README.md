# Measurement Error Mitigation

Everything about the tests, attempts and others on the enhancement of measurement error mitigation. Below is the details of each notebook:

* `calibration_experiment`: include the basic knowledge about measurement error, the construction of response matrix and one example of response matrix.
* `gamma_matrix`: include how to take state-preparation error into consideration and make a precise response matrix (the $\Gamma$ matrix).
